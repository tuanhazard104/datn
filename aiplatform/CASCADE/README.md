# CASCADE

This is the implementation of [Medical Image Segmentation via Cascaded Attention Decoding, WACV 2023](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Rahman_Medical_Image_Segmentation_via_Cascaded_Attention_Decoding_WACV_2023_paper.html). 


## Usage:
### Recommended environment:
```
Python 3.8
Pytorch 1.11.0
torchvision 0.12.0
```
Please use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the dependencies.

### Data preparation:
- Synapse Multi-organ dataset:
Sign up in the [official Synapse website](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/89480) and download the dataset. Then split the 'RawData' folder into 'TrainSet' (18 scans) and 'TestSet' (12 scans) following the [TransUNet's](https://github.com/Beckschen/TransUNet/blob/main/datasets/README.md) lists and put in the './data/synapse/Abdomen/RawData/' folder. Finally, preprocess using 'python ./utils/preprocess_synapse_data.py' and save in the './data/synapse/' folder. 

- ACDC dataset:
Download the preprocessed ACDC dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qYHNIWTIBzwyFgScORL2RFd002vrPF2/view) and move into './data/ACDC/' folder.

- Polyp datasets:
Download training and testing datasets [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pFxb9NbM8mj_rlSawTlcXG1OdVGAbRQC/view?usp=sharing) and move them into './data/polyp/'.


### Pretrained model:
You should download the pretrained PVTv2 model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Eu8v9vMRvt-dyCH0XSV2i77lAd62nPXV?usp=sharing), and then put it in the './pretrained_pth/pvt/' folder for initialization. 

Download Google pretrained ViT models (R50-ViT-B_16, ViT-B_16, ...) from [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/vit_models/imagenet21k) or use "wget https://storage.googleapis.com/vit_models/imagenet21k/{MODEL_NAME}.npz", and then put them in the './pretrained_pth/vit/imagenet21k/' folder for initialization. 

### Training:
```
cd into CASCADE
```
For Polyp training run "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -W ignore train_polyp.py" 

For Synapse Multi-organ training run "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -W ignore train_synapse.py"

For ACDC training run "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -W ignore train_ACDC.py"

### Testing:
```
cd into CASCADE 
```
For Polyp testing run "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -W ignore test_polyp.py" 

For Synapse Multi-organ testing run "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -W ignore test_synapse.py"

For ACDC testing run "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -W ignore test_ACDC.py"
